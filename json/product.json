They may both boost your plants’ nutrients, but they do so in different ways.Rather than boosting nutrients in your soil, soil amending products improve its texture. These materials promote crumbling, which creates the air and water pockets roots need to find nourishment.

In one page, we’ll cover the basics of using fertilizers in your gardenAs well as having soil that’s rich in organic matter (compost!), plants often need an application of fertilizer to get the nutrients that they need.. For example, tomatoes need to grow in soil that has plenty of calcium. If you’ve grown and harvested plants in your garden in the past, these crops took up the nutrients from the soil, and those nutrients should be replaced in the spring before more plants are grown there. This is where fertilizer (organic or processed) plays a role. Fertilizers replace lost nutrients, which ensures that soil nutrient levels are at an acceptable level for healthy growth.","image":"images/s4.jpg"}

Tiny seeds like basil and lettuce should only have enough soil sprinkled on top of them to protect them from drying out or blowing away. It also helps to lightly press the seed into the soil surface.Seeds sown in outdoor garden beds can be particularly difficult because you can’t control the outdoor seeding environment very much. You don’t have the cozy predictable environment of a windowsill or greenhouse, nor do you have the enclosed container of a seed tray.Temperature, rainfall, storms, or pests are at the whim of Mother Nature.
